Welcome back! By now you are able to create fully-connected feed forward NNs. In this chapter we will see how NNs can be used for processing images.

## Example: Image classification!

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7b1a21f347"
```

`@part1`
Is there a car in the picture?{{1}}

`@script`
Consider this example: You have been asked to train a NN that is able to detect if there is a car in a given picture. This is useful in automated driving applications.

The picture to the left does contain a car. The one to the right doesn't. This is a binary classification problem.

## Using dense feed forward NNs for image classification

Each picture has to be passed to the NN for training.{{2}}


`@script`
Suppose you have a dataset of pictures with or without cars in them and the dataset is labeled. Let's see what happens if we use a dense feed forward NN.
Each picture in the dataset, along with its label has to be passed to the NN for training.

- Assume each picture is 200 by 100 pixels and is greyscale.{{1}}
- This means that our input layer has 200x100=20,000 nodes.{{2}}
- Let's say that our first hidden layer has 100 nodes.{{3}}

- ###### We need to train 2,000,100 weight only for the first layer!{{5}}


`@script`
Assume each picture is 200 by 100 pixels and is greyscale. In greyscale images, each pixel has an integer value between 0 and 255. Zero for black and 255 for white. The numbers in between, represent different shades of grey.
This means out input layer has 200x100=20,000 nodes.
Let's say that our first hidden layer has 100 nodes.
We need to learn around 2 million parameters only for the first layer!

This is a problem and makes dense NNs impractical for this application. The way to get around it is to use CNNs. In the next exercise, we will learn about these networks.
